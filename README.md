This repository contains the code for a project to scrape alll the articles on
Fangraphs and send an email attachment containing the articles.

There are four files in the scripts directory:
1. a_scrape_articles.py
2. b_email.py
3. c_run_all.py
4. utils.py

The scripts are run daily using the job scheduler Cron.

Here is a link to my <a href="https://ericchan24.github.io/automation/cron/email/web%20scraping/2019/11/30/Keep-Up-With-the-News-Using-Python/" target="_blank">blog post!</a>
